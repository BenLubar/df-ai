I wiped the save and started a new world, and hit this soft-lock again ay year 7, during a goblin invasion.\n- Squad 1 has assigned targets, but 2 \u0026 3 do not. \n- Squad 3 has zero members\n- I can `esc` out and the game \u0026 ai continue normally, but only squad 1 heads into battle battle\n  - Side-note - Perhaps future enhancement could check if squads are idle? ex: one squad went down to fight a forgotten beast, while the others went up to fight a siege? (Maybe the AI already handles this?)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8008527/43052541-caa79f18-8df4-11e8-8b42-25a6f76d1d91.png)\n\n\n### Console Log\n```\n00007-10-02:0990 found next cavern\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Frills of Working to kill Smunstu Aslotsaslu, Goblin Spearman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Fenced Fortifications to kill Osta Urarstato, Goblin Pikeman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Frills of Working to kill Ngoso Urarangot, Goblin Lasher: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Fenced Fortifications to kill Strodno Ultaslaxu, Goblin Bowman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Frills of Working to kill Tode Omospostest, Goblin Hammerman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Fenced Fortifications to kill Nako Utesdusmun, Goblin Axeman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Mechanical Champions to kill Ngokang Uksosmugub, Goblin Axeman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Frills of Working to kill Smunstu Spubtastosbûb, Goblin Bowman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Fenced Fortifications to kill Atu Okalsong, Goblin Spearman: marauder\n00007-10-03:0001 Ordering squad The Mechanical Champions to kill Quelge Ejedatkil, Goblin Hammerman: marauder\n\n```\n\n-------\n\n### ai status\n(df-ai from 7/20/18 build master)\n```\n[DFHack]# ai\nDwarf Fortress 0.44.12\n  Windows 64-bit\ndf-ai 0.44.12-r1-7-g4f1caba0\n  code 4f1caba055d0b53f839557707b9a326d9daf94a7\nDFHack 0.44.12-r1-0-gc2a64b35\n  library c2a64b3573abbee549761f5c1c2626eec7a6e81c\n  structures 23500e4e9bd1885365d0a2ef1746c321c1dd5094\nPlan: check_furnish: 55, check_idle: 1, check_rooms: 1, construct_activityzone: 1, construct_farmplot: 120, dig_room: 3, furnish: 503, monitor_farm_irrigation: 120, setup_farmplot: 34, want_dig: 92, waiting to dig: bedroom (plan)\nfurnishing: archery_target: 5, armor_stand: 56, bed: 54, bookcase: 1, cabinet: 62, cage: 24, chair: 5, chest: 63, coffin: 72, door: 107, hatch: 32, restraint: 10, table: 1, traction_bench: 7, weapon_rack: 9\nPop: 94 citizen, 5 military, 21 pet, 0 visitor, 0 resident\nStocks: need: armor_feet, armor_hands, armor_head, armor_legs, armor_shield, armor_stand, armor_torso, backpack, barrel, bed, bin, cabinet, cage_metal, chair, chest, clothes_feet, clothes_hands, clothes_head, clothes_legs, clothes_torso, coal, coffin, door, dye, dye_seeds, flask, food_storage, gypsum, hatch_cover, paper, plaster_powder, quire, raw_coke, rope, slurry, table, thread_seeds, traction_bench, weapon_rack, weapon_ranged; use: clay, cloth_nodye, drink_fruit, drink_plant, food_ingredients, metal_ore, mill_plant, rough_gem, tallow, wool\nCamera: inactive (previously: Inod Rigòthsat, hammerer; Sigun Rigòthnåzom, Weaponsmith; Etur Lolorònul, Miller)\n[DFHack]#\n```","files":null}]}
