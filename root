The screen has the squad selected and is awaiting for the target to be selected from a list.\n\nManual fix is to select the creature manually and to resume the game.\n\nSide-note: While not entirely tested, I felt the AI was frozen after manually selecting the target.  As if the AI froze at target selection or after user interaction\n\n\n**Version Info:**\n- DF-AI `0.44.12-r1` from [7/17/18 Buildmaster](https://buildmaster.local.lubar.me/applications/2/builds/build?releaseNumber=0.0.0\u0026buildNumber=180717001)\n- DFHack `0.44.12-r1-0-gc2a64b35`","files":null}]}
