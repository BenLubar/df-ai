My dwarves have been running all around the map with little to no success in dispatching these sinful creatures.\n\nPerhaps after x-ticks, if the target(s) are still alive, disengage for a bit of time?\n\n - Are you able to check if the unit is pathable? (this way large ground battles aren't disengaged)\n\n - If x-ticks have elapsed and neither dwarves or hostile takes damage, take a break?","files":null}]}
