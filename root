This may be due to multiple gaming sessions.  Always the same game \u0026 ai version, just multiple save/loads/`enable df-ai`'s\n\n- **Example 1:**\n   Overlapping didn't seem like much of an issue until I noticed that most of my fort was depressed and horrified, from constantly seeing bodies and bone refuse.\n\n - **Example 2:**\n   Dwarves were trapped down in the mines, as a z-level of their mineshaft was removed for a new fortress room.  Noticed as I started seeing inaccessible item \u0026 dehydration/starvation messages.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nPrevent structure overlapping or at least ensure bodies and refuse stockpiles are enclosed.\n\n**Visual reference**\n- See top middle and bottom right\n- I was attempting to wall off the bones at top middle before taking screenshot\n- Also note the many blocks of stairways\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8008527/43839071-31ba2c9a-9aeb-11e8-916a-845eece5e389.png)\n\n\n**ai version:**\n```\nDwarf Fortress 0.44.12\n  Windows 64-bit\ndf-ai 0.44.12-r1-update1-6-gc32576d7 (Build ID: df-ai-pre-0.44.12-r1-180805000)\n  code c32576d7b45f1336ad9f28272f6856655f80934e\nDFHack 0.44.12-r1-0-gc2a64b35 (Build ID: df-ai-pre-0.44.12-r1-180805000)\n  library c2a64b3573abbee549761f5c1c2626eec7a6e81c\n  structures 23500e4e9bd1885365d0a2ef1746c321c1dd5094\n```","files":null}]}
