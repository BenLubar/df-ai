I need to write some code that makes sure miners are never unassigned or given alternate jobs unless something catastrophic happens like the population of the fort going down to 1 dwarf. If the miners don't get unassigned, they won't drop their pickaxes, and the pickaxes won't be considered to be blocking the cistern from being ready.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"5ff63cc106aa5ba7b893d7126eb025e41b25a791"},"timestamp":1496521356,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMDg5NDUzNDY="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"5ff63cc106aa5ba7b893d7126eb025e41b25a791"},"timestamp":1496523315,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEwODk1MjYxMQ=="},"status":2}]}
