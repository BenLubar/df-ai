Perhaps bigger shafts closer to the map edge?\n\n**Visual reference**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8008527/44113112-029569cc-9fd5-11e8-8ad2-49ce8721c367.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8008527/44113116-0669b2ba-9fd5-11e8-96b8-cee846e67335.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8008527/44113535-6fa424e4-9fd6-11e8-9b8d-745af483292c.png)\n\n\n**ai version:**\n```\nDwarf Fortress 0.44.12\n  Windows 64-bit\ndf-ai 0.44.12-r1-update1-8-g7b306e26 (Build ID: df-ai-pre-0.44.12-r1-180810000)\n  code 7b306e2669d0c4fd933a73e360e5f9f0a7ba7ee6\nDFHack 0.44.12-r1-0-gc2a64b35 (Build ID: df-ai-pre-0.44.12-r1-180810000)\n  library c2a64b3573abbee549761f5c1c2626eec7a6e81c\n  structures 23500e4e9bd1885365d0a2ef1746c321c1dd5094\n```","files":null}]}
