Watch Dwarf Fortress play itself !

Script for DFHack 0.34.11-r3

Installation: copy all files to df/hack/scripts

Start a fresh embark on an area with no aquifer, and with the caverns not too close to the surface.
For best results, choose a site with a river on the west side.

Run 'ai start' in the dfhack console, thats all.

Does not handle already started forts, or resume from saved game.
